# Digital-Mask
The Digital Mask is a medical privacy protection technology based on 3D face reconstruction and deep learning. It takes original videos of patients as input, and outputs DM-reconstructed videos after digitalization. The DM-reconstructed videos can erase the identity attributes while retaining the clinical attributes needed for diagnosis and management.
